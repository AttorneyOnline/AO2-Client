# License Change Notice

## What Changed

This project was previously dual-licensed under both MIT and GPLv3 licenses.
The project is now exclusively licensed under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license.

**Effective for any commit after `4db979187386326df64b9359b8de5e90468f7fc3`, tagged as `last-dual-licensed`, all new contributions and releases are licensed exclusively under GPLv3.**

## Impact on Existing Forks

If you forked this repository when it was available under the MIT license:

### Your Existing Fork
- **You can continue using your existing fork under the MIT license** for any code that was committed before this license change
- The MIT license you received for that specific version remains valid and irrevocable
- You are not required to change the license of your existing fork

### Pulling New Changes
If you pull new commits from our repository into your MIT-licensed fork:

- **New code from us will be GPLv3-licensed**
- This creates a mixed-license situation in your repository
- Any binary built from a mixed tree must comply with GPL v3 for the whole work unless you can isolate the MIT parts as separate, independent modules

### Your Options

1. **Keep your current fork as-is** under MIT license and stop pulling our updates
2. **Accept the GPLv3 license** and continue receiving updates from upstream
3. **Fork from the last MIT commit** and maintain your own separate development

## Recommendations

- Review the differences between MIT and GPLv3 licenses to understand the implications
- Consider whether GPLv3's copyleft requirements are compatible with your project goals
